        <h2>Chapter 5: My Berlin Session (My BS haha!)</h2><br>
        <p>
           In the past month I had a lot of opportunities to pull out my camera and shoot! I went to the christmas market and had a one day trip to Berlin. The christmas market was super fun, especially because it posed an ideal environment to experiment with low light photography! I did not have any leads on how to go about it. I took some time messing around with the exposure triangle and finally hit the sweet spot! Had to make sure the ISO was as minimum as possible (If I wanted grains, I would’ve gone to sea haha!). Something about a ferris wheel with neon lights fit so well into this <a href='https://www.instagram.com/p/CmfRbNbDnd7/' target="_blank">picture</a>. I did have certain pictures I wanted to try and shoot but unfortunately hadn’t built up the courage to approach them. This is something I had to deal with when I started doing street photography. I used to be quite anxious about taking pictures in public but when I realised that this is hindering the flow of my creative juices, I let my frontal cortex take the wheel and found myself free of the chains of anxiety. But during the Christmas market session  there were a lot of people which made me quite anxious and I found myself bound again! But I have since pondered on and regretted the missed opportunity and have decided to just go for it the next time.
           <br><br>
           My trip to Berlin was super productive! I think I might frequent the place whenever I find the time for some street photography. The place is a gold mine for street photography! I finally got around to meddling with focus points. I personally believe the automatic option limits my control over the picture (at least with respect to my bear and bones camera) as I will have to keep refocusing if it does not lock onto what I consider as the subject. I did want to mess around with the metering modes but it was too late in the session by the time I realised. It has been quite some time since the course where I had learnt all the features of the DSLR so it’s all slowly coming back to me as I keep going on sessions. This was one of the main reasons I went for a bear and bones camera, to strengthen my fundamentals! I shot some bangers and tried a couple long exposure shots which will be on my instagram soon! I still haven’t gotten to taking some panning shots! But I have gotten the hang of framing which feels quite nice!
           <br><br>
           I learnt a valuable life lesson during my session in Berlin. There was a street juggler juggling glowing balls in the night! I thought it would make for a nice long exposure shot and tried to take a picture. He was startled and dropped the balls! I realised it was because of me and immediately apologised. I still feel really guilty about it. It’s always nice to explore stuff but not at the cost of others feelings or personal space. I was so excited about the shot I ended up being insensitive. So from now on I’m going to be more aware of my surroundings while on session.
           <br><br>
           I also got some long exposure <a href='https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm4rFR4Drla/' target="_blank">shots</a> of the fireworks that went off on new years eve. I was quite satisfied with how cool the pictures turned out to be. The focusing was quite tricky due to the lack of light and the timing had to be precise but once I got the hang of it, it was fine.
           <br><br>
           My post processing has gotten better, I now understand its significance! Never really understood when I was doing the course! Also I’ve come to realise that even if the pictures look good on the screen on the camera, it can be misleading due to the lighting of the environment you’re shooting in! Always read the exposure form the <a href='https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/photography/discover/how-to-read-a-histogram.html' target="_blank">histogram</a>!One more thing I had recently figured once I started editing my pictures is to always shoot in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format' target="_blank">RAW</a>! It gives you more freedom during post processing. Here’s why; <a href=' https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/file-types/image/comparison/jpeg-vs-raw.html#:~:text=The%20main%20difference%20between%20any,digital%20camera%27s%20sensors%2C%20completely%20uncompressed.' target="_blank">JPEG vs RAW</a>.

        <h2>Chapter 4: Winter is Coming</h2><br>
        <p>
          Yes, the title is a Game of Thrones reference. Since winter is almost here, the sun sets by 16:30 and low light photography is quite tricky and I do not own a tripod. So all my shooting has to be done before the sun sets. In addition to the sky getting dark so early, it gets super cold. It was 0 degrees celsius during my last photo session. I hadn’t checked the operating temperature of my camera and luckily it was 0-40 degrees celsius. But the last photo session was one of my best experiences to date. I was having so much fun and felt so alive!
          <br><br>
          It had snowed the past couple of days and snow was melting on the day of my session. I realised that  this was the perfect opportunity to try some reflection shots. This was my first ever time trying this, so I was excited. Initially it was quite hard to figure the angles and focus as I could see almost nothing since I was shooting the reflection of the puddle near a footpath and I was freezing my ass off! But as I kept at it, I slowly started to get the hang of it! My recent is two different reflection shots which I really like. I shot a banger of a picture which had the perfect reflection of a tram, but unfortunately the puddle wasn’t big enough and I couldn’t obtain the complete reflection I wanted. But now that I have the hang of it, I can’t wait to shoot some reflection shots again when the opportunity presents itself. I don’t necessarily have to wait for puddles, just need to observe more keenly during my future endeavours.
          <br><br>
          I also learnt that it is possible to create the image you see with your eyes, you just gotta keep at it. I would’ve taken around 50 shots of the same view on multiple occasions. I was never satisfied but I had this picture in my mind, I wanted it so bad, I kept going back. I think I finally have the picture I was going for. Like I mentioned in the preceding blogs, I am slowly figuring out framing. So I realised if I just kept at it, I would eventually figure it out and that’s what happened! Just keep in mind that everyday is an amazing day, just put yourself out there and you never know what the world has waiting for you!
          <br><br>
          Christmas is just around the corner and I am super excited to shoot at night. The entire city will be lit and it’s going to be so much fun. I reckon my next update is going to be after my christmas shoot.

        <h2>Chapter 3: Leipzig and Street Photography</h2><br>
        <p>
          I had gotten accepted to Leipzig University, Germany for my masters and moved. As mentioned in one of the previous blogs, my phone camera stopped working. I also did not have any time during the beginning of my course to dedicate to photography. Within a couple months I had purchased an ipad air 4th gen for academic purposes, as absurd as this sounds I did try to do some photography with the ipad but let’s just say that it wasn’t the most efficient. (I’m not saying it’s not possible, but I just wasn’t too comfortable with handling the device for photography, come on it’s fucking huge! (Haha, that’s what she said)) Then finally I got a DSLR.
          <br><br>
          I have always been intrigued by street photography. I did learn a lot about photography in the course with this aspect in mind and Europe has one of the best settings for street photography. So I decided to give street photography a go. It’s been going good so far, I don’t shoot bangers everytime I go out, but I am learning so much in the process and I am having loads of fun. I am learning a lot of new things. It took me some time to figure out the framing as I only used to shoot macro. I use <a href='https://www.photopea.com/?utm_source=homescreen' target='_blank'>photopea</a> which is an amazing open source photoshop like online free editor which is perfect for my editing. These two pictures, the <a href='https://www.instagram.com/p/CkyWUPGjvMo/' target='_blank'>symmetric contrast shot</a> and the <a href='https://www.instagram.com/p/Ck85vTxj2kS/' target='_blank'>leading lines shot</a> are my personal favourites in recent times. The <a href='https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/photography/discover/leading-lines-photography.html' target='_blank'>leading lines</a> shot is the best of that kind I’ve taken so far!
          <br><br>
          I’ve always wanted to do everything from scratch which helps me get a better insight in whatever I’m doing. This is what helps me personify my pictures ; it helps me find what gives the picture some sort of flavour so to speak and every type of photography has different flavours that spice it up. So this is what I’m currently up to, finding my spices to cook delicious meals in street photography! I also refrain from checking out a lot of content online because I try to strive for originality!

        <h2>Chapter 2: My Equipment History</h2><br>
        <p>
          So I had mentioned that I started my journey with my phone at that time. It was a Xiaomi note 5 pro which had a 12MP primary sensor which is a  f/2.2 aperture equivalent and a secondary 5MP sensor for depth (I’m guessing this means lower aperture as I couldn’t find the exact details online). I mostly shot in pro mode where I could play around with the exposure triangle (Shutter speed, Aperture and ISO). It did take some interesting pictures given that it was an average priced mobile phone camera.
          <br><br>
          Then I made my switch to the One plus 7 pro which had a phenomenal camera for a mobile phone. It had a 48 MP primary sensor which is a 26mm equivalent lens with f/1.6 (which is exceptional for portrait photos), 16 MP ultra wide sensor which is a 17mm equivalent lens with f/2.2 and a 8 MP sensor which is a 78mm equivalent lens with f/2.4 dedicated to do zoom shots using the tele-lens. This was definitely an upgrade to the camera on my previous device. Most of my photography up until when I moved to Leipzig was using this device. I had an amazing experience with the camera on this phone! Unfortunately the camera stopped working the day I moved to Leipzig, literally on the same day!
          <br><br>
          After a year I finally got myself a Canon 100D and a Kit lens (18-55 mm with f/3.5 - 5) with which I currently shoot! The reason I went for this model is because you can get it for around 150-200 euros which is around the budget I had in mind and it is a Bears and Bones camera which will help me concretise my fundamentals and expand my knowledge. I have my eyes on the Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II USM lens which is a phenomenal lens but it’s quite expensive and I will not be getting it in the near future. I also want a good prime lens and a macro lens. But that is all for my equipment history.

        <h2>Chapter 1: Prologue</h2><br>
        <p>
          Photography began as a hobby when I attended a photography course for extra credits during my undergrad days. The course was really intriguing and little did I know that it would become a means through which I portray my perception of the world. I learnt a lot of cool stuff during the course (All of which I will talk about in future updates where I reference them in my experiences) that helped me capture images the way I used to see them! The course ended leaving me with this unquenchable thirst to explore photography but sadly I did not own a DSLR. Like the saying goes “Where there’s a will, there’s a way”, My perspective on photography which is that the entire process of photography goes on in your head and does not depend on your equipment, helped me figure out a solution to the aforementioned problem. I picked up my mobile phone at that time (Equipment description in future updates) to give it a shot (Pun intended). This really helped me hone my creativity through the years.
          <br><br>
          During the course, I developed a keen interest in capturing patterns and shooting subjects of very small scale, so I decided to dwell in macro photography. I wanted a platform to handle my photography and since I was most comfortable with Instagram, I created an Instagram account dedicated to my photography. This was a good decision as it helped me sort of organise my shots and have a groomed platform to portray my perception of the world. Then the pandemic hit. I used it to my advantage and just kept shooting on the terrace of my house. My subjects were insects. You will not believe the different types of insects that live around you haha! You can check some of my older posts, I bet you will be surprised that I found these on my terrace. They look like something out of an ant-man movie haha! It’s a whole different world at that scale. Then I moved to Leipzig, Germany for my master’s which is where I currently shoot.
          <br><br>
          So this blog is mostly about my general experience with photography. Here are certain values which have always stuck by me which have helped me come a long way:
          <br><br>
          <ol>
            <li>I’ve always done what I really wanted irrespective of what anybody would say about my pictures, I think this is really important at least in photography as taste in photography is subjective but that doesn't mean you do not channel constructive criticism in a positive way which helps you improve.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I think the most important thing in photography is to experiment and try out new things. It doesn't matter if you’re not shooting bangers every single time, all that matters is you’re having fun shooting.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Once my instructor from the course said to me that a photograph can break every single rule you know about photography and still be an insane shot. That’s what intrigued me the most about photography!</li>
          </ol>
