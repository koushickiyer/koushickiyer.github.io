        <h2>Leipzig and Street Photography</h2><br>
        <p>
          I had gotten accepted to Leipzig University, Germany for my masters and moved. As mentioned in one of the previous blogs, my phone camera stopped working. I also did not have any time during the beginning of my course to dedicate to photography. Within a couple months I had purchased an ipad air 4th gen for academic purposes, as absurd as this sounds I did try to do some photography with the ipad but let’s just say that it wasn’t the most efficient. (I’m not saying it’s not possible, but I just wasn’t too comfortable with handling the device for photography, come on it’s fucking huge! (Haha, that’s what she said)) Then finally I got a DSLR.
          <br><br>
          I have always been intrigued by street photography. I did learn a lot about photography in the course with this aspect in mind and Europe has one of the best settings for street photography. So I decided to give street photography a go. It’s been going good so far, I don’t shoot bangers everytime I go out, but I am learning so much in the process and I am having loads of fun. I am learning a lot of new things. It took me some time to figure out the framing as I only used to shoot macro. I use <a href='https://www.photopea.com/?utm_source=homescreen' target='_blank'>photopea</a> which is an amazing open source photoshop like online free editor which is perfect for my editing. These two pictures <a href='https://www.instagram.com/p/CkyWUPGjvMo/' target='_blank'>A</a> and <a href='https://www.instagram.com/p/Ck85vTxj2kS/' target='_blank'>B</a> are my personal favourites in recent times. ‘A’ shows a very nice contrast and ‘B’ is the best <a href='' target='_blank'>Leading lines</a> shot I’ve taken to date!
          <br><br>
          I’ve always wanted to do everything from scratch which helps me get a better insight in whatever I’m doing. This is what helps me personify my pictures ; it helps me find what gives the picture some sort of flavour so to speak and every type of photography has different flavours that spice it up. So this is what I’m currently up to, finding my spices to cook delicious meals in street photography! I also refrain from checking out a lot of content online because I try to strive for originality!

        <h2>Prologue</h2><br>
        <p>
          Photography began as a hobby when I attended a photography course for extra credits during my undergrad days. The course was really intriguing and little did I know that it would become a means through which I portray my perception of the world. I learnt a lot of cool stuff during the course (All of which I will talk about in future updates where I reference them with experiences) that helped me capture images the way I used to see them! The course ended leaving me with this unquenchable thirst to explore photography but sadly I did not own a DSLR. Like the saying goes “Where there’s a will, there’s a way”, My perspective on photography which is that the entire process of photography goes on in your head and does not depend on your equipment, helped me figure out a solution to the aforementioned problem. I picked up my mobile phone at that time (Equipment description in future updates) to give it a shot (Pun intended). This really helped me hone my creativity through the years.
          <br><br>
          During the course, I developed a keen interest in capturing patterns and shooting subjects of very small scale, so I decided to dwell in macro photography. I wanted a platform to handle my photography and since I was most comfortable with Instagram hence, I created an Instagram account dedicated to my photography. This was a good decision as it helped me sort of organise my photography  and have a groomed platform to portray my perception of the world. Then the pandemic hit. I used it to my advantage and just kept shooting on the terrace of my house. My subjects were insects. You will not believe the different types of insects that live around you haha! You can check some of my older posts, I bet you will be surprised that I found these on my terrace, they look like something out of a spiderman movie haha! Then I moved to Leipzig, Germany for my master’s which is where I currently shoot.
          <br><br>
          So this blog is mostly about my general experience with photography. Here are certain values which have always stuck by me which have helped me come a long way:
          <br><br>
          <ol>
            <li>I’ve always done what I really wanted irrespective of what anybody would say about my pictures, I think this is really important at least in photography as taste in photography is subjective but that doesn't mean you do not channel constructive criticism in a positive way which helps you improve.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I think the most important thing in photography is to experiment and try out new things. It doesn't matter if you’re not shooting bangers every single time, all that matters is you’re having fun shooting.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Once my instructor from the course said to me that a photograph can break every single rule you know about photography and still be an insane shot. That’s what intrigued me the most about photography!</li>
          </ol>
