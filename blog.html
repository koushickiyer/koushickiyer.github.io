        <h2>How it all began.</h2>

          Greetings of the day!
          <br><br>
          Photography began as a hobby when I picked up a “Basics of photography” co-curricular course in my undergrad. During that time, I developed a keen interest in photography and it soon developed into a means of sharing how I perceived the world. I really enjoyed the course. I was learning a lot of cool stuff like playing around with the shutter speed and capturing long exposure photos, how the aperture affects the depth of field of the image, basically all the things I used to find amazing when I used to look at photographs online but did not really know how these pictures were taken. By the end of course I had learnt so many cool things to do but sadly I did not own a DSLR at this point. I was really bummed out because I knew there was no way I could get a DSLR in the near future. Then it struck me, I could always try to take pictures with my mobile phone, but how would that make a difference? I’ve owned a mobile since forever! But, after the course I had a new approach to photography, It’s more the idea behind the picture. What goes on in your head comes before the equipment. I mean of course there is a huge difference between taking pictures with a mobile and a DSLR. But, I could at least hone my creativity. Also, not to mention the skill set I had developed throughout the course.
          <br><br>
          During the course I had developed a keen interest towards patterns and subjects at the macro scale, that’s when I realized that macro photography is the way to go! Also, when it comes to mobile photography, in my opinion it is easier to capture macro than any other form of photography. (I’m not saying that macro is the easiest, I have seen some amazing pictures shot on the phone. You can check out <a href='https://www.instagram.com/audiphotography/' target='_blank'>Auditya Venkatesh</a> for some amazing mobile photography. The pictures he takes are surreal!) So all of these thoughts motivated me to pick up my then mobile phone a Xiaomi note 5 pro (which had a 12MP primary sensor which is a  f/2.2 aperture equivalent and a secondary 5Mp sensor for depth (I’m guessing this means lower aperture as I couldn’t find the exact details online) and started to test things out. I mostly used to take pictures in the pro mode where I could play around with the exposure triangle. To my surprise I ended up taking some really good pictures.
          <br><br>
          I decided to make an instagram account just for photography. I did not care much for an audience as I only wanted a form of media to handle my photography and I was mostly used to Instagram. But people seemed to appreciate my pictures. Though I was not looking for validation, this motivated me to maintain the page (By motivation I mean I spent time trying to add captions relating to the picture haha, basically a well groomed instagram page), But I made sure that this did not influence my interest in photography. I did what I really wanted irrespective of what anybody would say about my pictures, I think this is really important at least in photography as taste in photography is subjective but that doesn't mean you do not channel constructive criticism in a positive way which helps you improve.
          <br><br>
          I finally made my switch to a One plus 7 pro which had a phenomenal camera for a mobile phone. It had a 48 MP primary sensor which is a 26mm equivalent lens with f/1.6 (which is exceptional for portrait photos), 16 MP ultra wide sensor which is a 17mm equivalent lens with f/2.2 and a 8 MP sensor which is a 78mm equivalent lens with f/2.4 dedicated to do zoom shots using the tele-lens. This was definitely an upgrade to the camera on my previous device. Most of my photography up until recently was using this device.
          <br><br>
          I was done with my course and then done with my undergrad and then the pandemic hit, this did not really affect my photography due to two reasons. One I was mostly doing macro photography so all my subjects were on the terrace of my house haha (This is because I used to live close to the outskirts of Bangalore, India and the neighborhood was mostly rural and hence the environment was rich with flora and fauna which were perfect my photography) and second this kind of forced me to think out of the box and in the process learn that there is so much that goes unnoticed in our everyday lives. (This is something similar to in the movie a peaceful warrior where there is a scene in which the protagonist is made to observe everything that goes on around him.) You can check out erin photography (I am currently unable to find her page), she had this amazing idea of constructing small models of outdoor situations for photography which kind of inspired me to not do something similar but to experiment with things on my own. That did not really work out well in the end though. But I think the most important thing is to experiment and try out new things.
          <br><br>
          It doesn't matter that you’re not shooting bangers every single time, all that matters is you’re having fun shooting. Once my instructor from the course said to me that a photograph can break every single rule you know about photography (e.g, the rule of odd numbers,the rule of thirds, leading lines, etcetera) and still be an insane shot. Things I picked up like this stuck with me and have helped me come a long way in photography.
          <br><br>
          I had gotten accepted to Leipzig University, Germany for my masters and moved here in Oct 2021. Unfortunately, my camera stopped working and that was the end of it. I also did not have any time during the beginning of my course to dedicate to photography. Within a couple months I had purchased an ipad air 4th gen for academic purposes, as absurd as this sounds I did try to do some photography with the ipad but let’s just say that it wasn’t the most efficient. (I’m not saying it’s not possible, but I just wasn’t too comfortable with handling the device for photography, come on it’s fucking huge!) Then finally a year later after contemplating my choices I finally got myself a Canon 100D with a kit lens. I needed a bear and bones camera. This is what I currently shoot with. This blog is to share my everyday experience with photography (Something like Jake does in Avatar but for photography of course haha). In this experience I will include the new things I learn in the process and my realizations. I am currently dabbling with street photography too! So there will be a lot more of that too! Thank you for giving your time to read! Have a lovely day!

          P.S : Here are some other photographers that I follow: <a href='https://www.instagram.com/shaazjung/' target='_blank'>Shaaz Jung</a>, <a href='https://www.instagram.com/pierretlambert/' target='_blank'>Pierre Lambert</a>, <a href='https://www.instagram.com/vinod__bharadwaj_sm/' target='_blank'>Vinod Bharadwaj</a>, <a href='https://www.instagram.com/theartofjanh/' target='_blank'>Jahnavi Bhujabal</a>. The later two are friends of mine who inspired me at some point in my life and you guys should definitely check them if you are into wildlife photography. Shaaz Jung is a well renowned wildlife photographer. One of the first works of Shaaz Jung that I had seen was his recreation of the Jungle book which you can find here. I was astonished, the first thought in my mind was this guy was something else!
          <br><br>
          I recently discovered Pierre Lambert through YouTube and I really love his content. I really love something he said. It went something along the lines that photography is something that happens in your head and does not depend on your equipment. As you’ve seen above this is my  perspective on photography too.
